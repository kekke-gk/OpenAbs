# OpenAbs

OpenAbs is a Google Chrome extension that allows you to quickly open the abstract page of a paper.

## How to use

When you are viewing a PDF of a paper, clicking on the extension's icon will open its abstract page as a new tab.
For example, if you are viewing https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf and click on the icon, https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661 will be opened.

Currently, the following two sites are supported.

- https://arxiv.org/
